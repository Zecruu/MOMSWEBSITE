# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- When setting up a Next.js server for mobile access, ensure the server is bound to 0.0.0.0 (all network interfaces) and that the firewall allows incoming connections on the server port
- Some ports may be blocked by default or reserved for other services; if one port doesn't work for mobile access, try using a different port (8080 worked when 3090 and 3051 didn't)
- When using Next.js 14, the Link component syntax has changed - children should no longer be wrapped in an <a> tag
- In PowerShell, do not use '&&' for command chaining as it's not supported. Use semicolons (;) or the pipeline operator (|) instead, or separate commands into multiple lines
- When adding Google Analytics to Next.js, use the Script component with strategy="afterInteractive" for better performance

## Current Task: Fixing mobile access to the Next.js development server

[X] Clone the repository from GitHub
[X] Examine the repository structure
[X] Install dependencies
[X] Start the development server
[X] Identify the issue with mobile access
[X] Create a firewall rule to allow incoming connections to port 3051
[X] Create a test page to verify the connection
[X] Test mobile access (port 3051 not working, port 8080 working)
[X] Change Next.js server port from 3051 to 3090
[X] Create firewall rule for port 3090
[X] Restart the server with the new port
[X] Create a test page for port 3090
[X] Verify mobile access is working with port 3090 (page is blank)
[X] Create simplified test pages to isolate the issue
[X] Create a simple HTTP server on port 8090 as an alternative test
[X] Create batch files for easier server management
[X] Add Google Analytics tracking to the website
[X] Create a simple HTTP server on port 8080
[X] Test the simple HTTP server on mobile (SUCCESS with port 8080)
[X] Change Next.js port to 8080 based on successful test
[X] Test the Next.js application on port 8080 from mobile
[X] Fix Rese√±as button in navbar (was pointing to /testimonials instead of /reviews)

### Project Structure
- Next.js project with pages directory structure
- Main pages: index.js, reviews.js, locate.js, products.js
- Components: Navbar.js, Footer.js, FloatingButtons.js, Map.js
- Using TailwindCSS for styling
- Google Analytics tracking ID: AW-16853281502

### Dependencies
- Next.js 14.1.0
- React 18.2.0
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Icons
- Styled Components
- TailwindCSS

### Development
- Development server running on port 8080 (changed from 3090 after testing)
- Server IP address: 192.168.68.63
- Mobile access URL: http://192.168.68.63:8080
- Created test pages: /test, /simple, and /basic to isolate the issue
- Created a simple HTTP server on ports 8090, 8080, and 8000 as alternative tests

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. Created multiple test pages with different levels of complexity
2. Created a simple HTTP server to test if the issue is specific to Next.js
3. Created batch files for easier server management
4. Opened firewall ports for different test servers
5. Tested different ports (3051, 3090, 8090, 8080, 8000)
6. Found that port 8080 works successfully for mobile access
7. Updated Next.js configuration to use port 8080
8. Fixed navigation links in Navbar component
